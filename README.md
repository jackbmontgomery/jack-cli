# jack-cli

I like being in the terminal most of the time when I am working. But when ideas or reminders come into my head it can distract me. I have created this simple cli tool to add, list and remove reminders from the command line.

I am learning rust at the moment and using this tool as a project to do so. Ideally we would have some db or something that is storing the items but for now they are just being stored in a plain text file in your .cache directory.
